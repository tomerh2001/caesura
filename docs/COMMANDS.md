> **[CLI flags and `config.yml` file options are documented in the options reference](OPTIONS.md)**

## `version`

Display version and dependency info.

```bash
caesura version
```

If any dependencies are missing they will be clearly indicated.

## `config`

Show resolved configuration with defaults.

```bash
caesura config
```

## `inspect`

The inspect command can be used on any directory of `.flac` or `.mp3` files.

It prints a table of metadata for each file followed by printing every tag and embeded image in the file.

It's useful for checking that the metadata of a source is correct before transcoding.

```bash
caesura inspect 142659
```

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/RogueOneEcho/assets-caesura/main/dist/inspect.gif)

## `verify`

Verify a FLAC source is suitable for transcoding.

```bash
caesura verify 142659
```

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/RogueOneEcho/assets-caesura/main/dist/verify.gif)

> [!TIP]
> For the source you can use a permalink, the numeric torrent id, or a path to a torrent file.
> Examples:
> - `caesura verify https://redacted.sh/torrents.php?id=80518&torrentid=142659#torrent142659`
> - `caesura verify 142659`
> - `caesura verify "../path/to/Artist - Hello World [2024].torrent"`

If it looks good you can proceed to transcoding, otherwise try another source.

## `spectrogram`

Generate full and zoomed spectrograms for review.

```bash
caesura spectrogram 142659
```

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/RogueOneEcho/assets-caesura/main/dist/spectrogram.gif)

Inspect the spectrograms in the output directory.

## `transcode`

Transcode FLAC to target formats.

```bash
caesura transcode 142659
```

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/RogueOneEcho/assets-caesura/main/dist/transcode.gif)

Inspect the transcodes in the output directory.

> [!TIP]
> Things to check:
> - Folder structure
> - File names
> - Tags
> - Audio quality
> - Image size and compression quality

## `upload`

Upload transcodes to your indexer.

> [!WARNING]
> You are responsible for everything you upload.
>
> Misuse of this application can result in the loss of your upload privileges.

> [!TIP]
> If you're unsure about this then you can append `--dry-run` to the command and instead of uploading it will print the data that would be submitted.

```bash
caesura upload 142659 --dry-run
```

```bash
caesura upload 142659
```

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/RogueOneEcho/assets-caesura/main/dist/upload.gif)

If you haven't already then add the `*.red.torrent` or `*.ops.torrent` file to your torrent client.

> [!TIP]
> `caesura` can automatically add the `.torrent` to your torrent client if it supports an autoadd directory.
>
> Either use the `--copy-torrent-to path/to/autoadd/directory` CLI option or add the following to `config.yml`
>
> ```yaml
> copy_torrent_to: path/to/autoadd/directory
> ```
>
> If using docker then ensure the path is mounted as a volume in `docker-compose.yml`.
>
> In qBittorrent you can configure auto add under: Options > Downloads > Automatically add torrents from
>
> Monitored Folder: `path/to/autoadd/directory`
>
> Override save location: `path/to/caesura/output`

Go to your indexer and check your uploads to make sure everything has gone to plan.

## `publish`

Publish a source FLAC release from a local directory using a YAML manifest.

> [!WARNING]
> This command is currently RED-only.
>
> You are responsible for everything you upload.
>
> Before running `publish`, manually verify:
> - metadata fields are correct for the edition/media you are uploading,
> - the release is not on RED's DNU list,
> - source files and logs (if applicable) meet tracker rules.

```bash
caesura publish /path/to/publish.yml
```

```bash
caesura publish /path/to/publish.yml --dry-run
```

> [!TIP]
> `publish` prepares source seeding before upload.
>
> By default the source directory is hard-linked into the first `content` directory.
>
> Use `--move-source` if you want to move files instead of hard-linking.
>
> If `copy_torrent_to` is set, the source `.torrent` is copied to that autoadd directory.
>
> If source staging or verification fails then `publish` fails before upload.
>
> If torrent injection fails then `publish` logs a warning and continues the upload.
>
> In `--dry-run` mode no source staging or torrent injection is performed.
>
> `publish` auto-generates BBCode release notes (tool/version, source format, details, hidden tags).
> The `release_desc` value in the manifest is included as the `Notes` line.

### New group example

```yaml
source_path: /path/to/source
torrent_path: /optional/path/to/output.torrent
release_desc: "Uploader notes to include under Notes in generated BBCode"
group:
  type: new_group
  title: "Album Title"
  year: 2024
  release_type: 1
  media: WEB
  tags: ["electronic", "ambient"]
  album_description: "Group description"
  request_id: 364781
  image: "https://example.com/cover.jpg"
  artists:
    - name: "Artist Name"
      role: 1
  edition:
    unknown_release: false
    remaster: true
    year: 2024
    title: "Digital"
    record_label: "Label"
    catalogue_number: "CAT-001"
    format: "FLAC"
    bitrate: "Lossless"
```

### Existing group example

```yaml
source_path: /path/to/source
torrent_path: /optional/path/to/output.torrent
release_desc: "Uploader notes to include under Notes in generated BBCode"
group:
  type: existing_group
  group_id: 123456
  remaster_year: 2024
  remaster_title: "Digital"
  remaster_record_label: "Label"
  remaster_catalogue_number: "CAT-001"
  media: "WEB"
  format: "FLAC"
  bitrate: "Lossless"
```

The command uploads only the source FLAC and then stops.
After success, run:

```bash
caesura transcode <torrent_id>
caesura upload <torrent_id>
```

## `batch`

Batch processing with queue management.

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/RogueOneEcho/assets-caesura/main/dist/batch.gif)

> [!WARNING]
> You are responsible for everything you upload.
>
> Misuse of this application, especially the `batch` command, can result in the loss of your upload privileges or a ban.

The `batch` command handles `verify`, `spectrogram`, `transcode` and `upload` in a single command.

### Queue management

Add torrents from a directory to the queue:

```bash
caesura queue add /path/to/your/torrents
```

> [!TIP]
> Instead of including the path as an argument you can set it in the config file:
> ```yaml
> queue_add_path: /srv/qBittorrent/BT_backup
> ```
> Then run the command as:
>
> ```bash
> caesura queue add
> ```

List what is next in the queue for the current `indexer`:

```bash
caesura queue list
```

Remove items from the queue:

```bash
caesura queue rm <HASH>
```

View queue progress summary:

```bash
caesura queue summary
```

### Progressive batch examples

By default the `batch` command will limit to processing just `3` transcodes and it won't create spectrograms or upload unless explicitly instructed. These safeguards are in place to prevent mistakenly uploading a bunch of sources that you haven't checked.

**Verify and transcode 3 sources:**

```bash
caesura batch --transcode
```

> [!TIP]
> Add the `--spectrogram` flag to generate spectrograms.

**Upload the transcodes you've already checked:**

```bash
caesura batch --transcode --upload
```

**Transcode everything (but don't upload):**

```bash
caesura batch --transcode --no-limit
```

**Upload in batches with a wait interval:**

```bash
caesura batch --upload --limit 10 --wait-before-upload 30s
```

> [!WARNING]
> In theory you can execute with both `--upload --no-limit` but that is probably a bad idea and a very fast way to lose your upload privileges.
>
> If you are going to do so then you should definitely use a long wait interval:
> `--upload --no-limit --wait-before-upload 2m`

### Analyzing the Queue

The `cache/queue` uses a YAML file format that can be analyzed with `yq`.

Filter to see what has been transcoded:

```bash
cat ./cache/queue/*.yml | yq 'map(select(.transcode != null))'
```

Or to see what has been skipped and why:

```bash
cat ./cache/queue/*.yml | yq 'map(select(.verify.verified == false))'
```

If you're working with a lot of files then `less` can be helpful:

```bash
cat ./cache/queue/*.yml | yq --colors 'map(select(.verify.verified == false))' | less -R
```
